        My name is Kevin Putala. I find myself often relating to my experience as more of an amalgamation in regards to the varying degree of fields I have dabbled in. <br>
        To begin, my career out of High School started by attending college in metro-Atlanta with my major being Electrical Engineering. After a while, I decided I would <br>
        move on to something else I enjoyed, Biology. This was soon followed by New Media Arts and Graphic Design, Anthropology, Geography, Electrical Engineer (again), and, <br>
        finally, deciding to nail it in with Computer Programming. <em>Wow</em>. That is only with my college career. After listing that out, I did college all wrong. Which <br>
        I continue to pass on to those under me and give them some guidance and foresight on what not to do.
        <br>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left; width: auto;">
        My working career is a little different. I joined the Army National Guard in the middle of all that. My job was as a wheeled vehicle mechanic (not track side). <br>
        I performed that job in conjunction with commercial automotive work for 3 years and, then 3 years solely as a military technician. I had the privelege of being <br>
        part of a blackhawk battalion during that time which peaked my interest in aviation. I decided then to switch to the Air Force Reserve as an avionics technician<br>
        Simultaneously, I received an offer to work at Gulfstream Aerospace in Savannah, GA. I have also performed as a lead contractor on military aircraft modifications.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left; width: auto;">
        Enough of the business. My hobbies include video games, soccer, automotive projects, woodworking, photography, programming, and graphic design.
