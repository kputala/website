<p style="text-align: center;"> 
My name is Kevin Putala. I find myself often relating to my experience as more of an amalgamation in regards to the varying degree of fields I have dabbled in.<br>
To begin, my career out of High School started by attending college in metro-Atlanta with my major being Electrical Engineering. After a while, I decided I would <br>
move on to something else I enjoyed, Biology. This was soon followed by New Media Arts and Graphic Design, Anthropology, Geography, Electrical Engineer (again), and, <br>
                         finally, deciding to nail it in with Computer Programming. <em>Wow</em>. That is only with my college career. After listing that out, I did college all wrong. Which I continue <br>
to pass on to those under me and give them some guidance and foresight on what not to do.<br>
  <br

  <br>
</p>
<p>
  My working career is a little different. I joined the Army National Guard in the middle of all that. My job was as a wheeled vehicle mechanic (not track side). <br>
  I performed that job in conjunction with commercial automotive work for 3 years and, then 3 years solely as a military technician. I had the privelege of being <br>
  part of a blackhawk battalion during that time which peaked my interest in aviation. I decided then to switch to the Air Force Reserve as an avionics technician<br>
  Simultaneously, I received an offer to work at Gulfstream Aerospace in Savannah, GA. I have also performed as a lead contractor on military aircraft modifications.<br>
</p>
    
<p> Enough of the business. My hobbies include video games, soccer, automotive projects, woodworking, photography, programming, and graphic design.<br>
  <b>In a not so quite nutshell, that is my experience.</b>
